## Header

### HTML

- Use the `<header>` element to create a distinct section at the top of the page.
Include the blog's title or logo within the header.
- Use the `<h1>` tag for the blog name.
- Optional: Add a brief tagline or description if needed.

### CSS

- Set a background image that reflects the blog's branding.

- Ensure good contrast between the text and background for accessibility.

## Navbar

### HTML

- Use the `<nav>` element to contain navigation links.
- Links should lead to different sections of the blog.
- Use anchor tags `<a>` to create navigation links.

### CSS

- Style the navbar for a clean, professional appearance: background color, padding,
hover effects on links.

## Main content

### HTML

- Use the `<main>` element to wrap all the primary content on the page.
- Within `<main>`, structure the blog posts using `<article>` elements,
each representing an individual post.
- Add a section for the comments underneath each post, which includes a form
for users to submit comments.

### CSS

- Include the blog title, summary, and links to the full posts within each `<article>`.
- Use images, videos, text, links and any other content relevant to the blog.
- The comment form can contain fields for users to enter their nickname and
comment text.

## Question form

### HTML

- Use the `<form>` element to create a contact or question form.
- Include input fields for the user's name, email, and message.
- Use the `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button>` elements for the form fields.

### CSS

- Make the form visually appealing and easy to use.
- Include clear labels for each form field and add padding/margins for ease of interaction.

## Footer

### HTML

- Use the `<footer>` element to create a footer section at the bottom of the page.
- Include social media links (GitHub, Instagram, Twitter) or
an email subscription form.

### CSS

- Make sure the footer is visually separated from the rest of the content.
This could involve a different background color or distinct sectioning.

## Extra Links (optional)

### HTML

- Use a `<aside>` element to mark the sidebar section. The sidebar will contain links
or other content like categories, recent posts, or external resources.
- Place the sidebar within the `<main>` area,
to the right of the blog posts.

### CSS

- Ensure that the sidebar visually stands out from the main content area.
Use a different background color, add padding, and give it a fixed width
to make it consistent across different screen sizes.
- Position the sidebar to the right of the main content area.

## Comment section (optional)

### HTML

- Inside the `<aside>` (for the sidebar), we can use `<form>` or/and `<div>` elements
to represent individual "messages" or comments.

### CSS

- Ensure that the sidebar visually stands out from the main content area.
Use a different background color, add padding, and give it a fixed width
to make it consistent across different screen sizes.
- Position the sidebar to the left of the main content area.
